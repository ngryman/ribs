***RIBS is still at an early development stage and is not ready for production yet!***.

***Development will start again soon with a new modern, full JavaScript + OpenCL architecture.
This version will still exist as RIBS Legacy.***

## Motivations

Responsive images is the next big challenge!

Some [client-side patterns] already exist along with [build tasks] in order to **produce**, **optimize**, **manage** and
**pick** the right image for the right screen size.

But they have several pitfalls.
The biggest one is that you often **load more that you are going to show**, wasting bandwidth, load time, device memory and CPU.

In the wild, this is not used as much as it should be. AFAIK this is probably because it asks a certain amount of time
to choose and implement a solution. It often involves too much tools and management in the process.
The fact is, developers don't take enough time for this and tend to neglect this part of a modern Web application.

I believe in the *on-the-fly* way of thinking that the Web can offer. So, you just ask the image you want,
and you receive it already processed, end of story.
This also guaranties that you:

- do not **load more than your are going to show**.
- do not **scale the image in CSS**.
- do not **load important images with javascript**.
- do not **handle each image sizes manually**.
- **do simply your workflow**.

*From [RESS slides]*.

Some great commercial services already exist to tackle this problem. But none of them is open source.
This needs to be available in the wild, with a good level of customization, so that Web developers
can leverage their images responsiveness.

## Goals

*RIBS* will:

- Provide **on-the-fly** processed images (no build phase required).
- Be **blazing fast**!
- Be **super easy** to use and deploy.
- **Proxy** existing servers so you can offload image processing.
- **Optimize and transcode** images.
- Support **SPDY**.
- Fit **web apps** but also **native apps** needs.
- Offer plugins to various existing platforms such as **WordPress** or **Joomla**.
- Allow **to extensively customize it** so you can achieve precisely what you want.
- Support [art direction], automatically perhaps?.

## Roadmap

 - `✓` Basic *Node* module.<br>
 - `✓` Command line interface.<br>
 - `✓` *Express* middleware with an effecient caching system.<br>
 - `✕` Plugins for **Grunt**, **Gulp**, ...<br>
 - `✕` Client-side library.<br>
 - `✕` New awesome features...

## Architecture

*RIBS* will offer several independent layers, that work well together:

- A native **Node** module that processes images:
  - **Fast** using [OpenCV] as backend.
  - **Extensible** via *custom operations*, *hooks* and *events*.
  - **Smart** ensuring always valid images are produced.
- An **Express** middleware that:
  - Expose a **REST API**.
  - **Proxy** existing servers.
  - **Cache** processed images smartly.
  - Support **clustering**.
- A **client-side** library to:
  - **Detect** device capabilities.
  - **Automatically** build URLs.
